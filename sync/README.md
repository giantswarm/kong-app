# Sync chart from upstream

We're trying to align the chart in this repository as closely as possible to the [kong upstream chart](https://github.com/Kong/charts/tree/main/charts/kong).

For this, [vendir](https://github.com/carvel-dev/vendir) and a series of [patches](https://github.com/giantswarm/kong-app/tree/main/sync/patches) are being used. See the `README.md` and `patch.sh` files inside the patch directories for more information about each patch.

**To sync the chart from upstream install `vendir` and execute `./sync/sync.sh` in the root of the repository.**
